# AppleScript Examples
A random collection of AppleScript examples and code snippets.

## Overview
This is a growing collection of AppleScript examples and snippets that started out for personal use but I decided to share to help others learn how to perform various tasks in AppleScript. Feel free to use these snippets in any way you need. Where appropriate, I will give credit to any code that I did not create. If you see a piece of your code and you would like for it to be removed, feel free to ping me. I am happy to oblige.

## Progress Bar Example
A simple example demonstrating how to implement a Progress Bar in your scripts.


## File Renamer
A simple AppleScript to rename files. I will add documentation to explain the code when time permits.

## Do Script in Terminal
Execute a shell script in the Terminal app. For the most part, this is not necessary as you can call shell scripts directly from AppleScript, but it is a useful technique to know, just in case.

## AppleScript Icons

A script that demonstrates how to use the different system icons in dialogs
